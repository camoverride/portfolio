<h1>Swarm</h1>

<p>
    Everyone who ever looks at this portrait has their face uploaded and combined
    into an always-evolving collective average. Much like how tech companies steal
    data from billions of people to create averages that don't exist in reality,
    <i>Traces</i> assembles these new humans before your very eyes, birthing new
    identities ready-made for exploitation.

<p>
    The images that this portrait produces are ghostly and strange, resembling
    simultaneously everyone who has viewed them as well as nobody who has ever
    existed. As technology companies pursue this spectral "average" they also
    reinforce "average" forms of behavior that do not -- and <b>should not</b>
    exist.
