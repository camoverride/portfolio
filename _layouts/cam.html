<p>I'm Cam Smith, a Seattle-based new media artist whose work explores themes of surveillance,
    AI, and the societal impact of technology.
    After beginning my career in academia studying psychology and linguistics,
    I transitioned to the tech industry
    where I worked on artificial intelligence projects in Silicon Valley.
    This experience informs my critical approach to the ways corporations and governments
    exploit personal data. My installations - ranging from immersive environments to small
    interactive pieces - use surveillance tools, AI, and mathematics to engage audiences
    in conversations about privacy, power, identity, and individual autonomy.
    My work has been exhibited in
    solo shows such as <i>Who's Watching Who?</i> at Base Camp Studios and I continue
     to use my art to foster public understanding of emerging technologies.</p>
