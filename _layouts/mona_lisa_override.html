    Mona Lisa Override is a video portrait project. A picture of the Mona Lisa is displayed on a monitor within an ornate picture frame. I hid a small camera within the frame. As a visitor approaches this familiar portrait of the Mona Lisa, they will see their face swapped with the portrait's. This project shows how deepfake technology will soon not be constrained simply to the internet. Governments and corporate interests have little interest in the truth, and will use deepfake technology to manipulate the outcomes of elections and consumer's beliefs about the world.

    Although this portrait appears playful at first glance, many of the guests at my show felt unsettled after their initial surprise and laughter.
