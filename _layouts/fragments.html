    As people observe this portrait, a hidden camera captures images of their 
    faces then aligns them, breaks them into fragments, and reassembles them along 
    with fragments of all past viewers into a constantly evolving digital mosaic.

    This live-generated artwork engages the audience as both viewer and participant, 
    creating a reciprocal experience where one's presence dynamically reshapes the
    artwork. Through this constantly evolving piece, <i>Fragments</i> explores the
    intersections of technology, identity, and observation, allowing viewers to witness
    the real-time construction of a collective identity.

    The ultimate goal of this piece is to raise questions about how the 
    technology industry harvests, exploits, and aggregates data from many 
    users all over the world into digital mosaics that do not exist in reality.
