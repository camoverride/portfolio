    <i>Fragments</i> transforms passive viewing into active participation by assembling live-generated collages of viewers' faces. When a person looks at the portraitâ€”displayed on a framed computer monitor, an embedded camera subtly captures their image, breaking it down into fragments that integrate seamlessly with a shifting mosaic of past viewers. Each face contributes to a layered collage, representing the way digital platforms abstract and recombine individual data.

    This live-generated artwork engages the audience as both viewer and participant, creating a reciprocal experience where one's presence dynamically reshapes the artwork. Through this constantly evolving piece, <i>Fragments</i> explores the intersections of technology, identity, and observation, allowing viewers to witness the real-time construction of a collective identity that is at once personal and universally abstracted.
</p>

<p>
    The ultimate goal of this piece is to raise questions about how the technology industry harvests, exploits, and aggregates data from many users all over the world.
