    <i>Fragments</i> is a digital collage project where I combined the faces of many people
    I saw on the streets of Seattle into composite images. I took each face, chopped it up
    into tiny fragments, and reassembled the pieces into composite frames.
    This work was inspired by the way technology companies create mathematical models
    of human behavior from millions of individuals, creating composites that only have a
    fuzzy connection with reality.

    Additionally, in the "framed" version of <i>Fragments</i> a hidden camera captures pictures of viewers' faces.
    These new pictures are then added to the
    composites, meaning that whoever looks at this picture has their data incorporated into it.

    The act of viewing is usually thought of as involving data moving in only one direction:
    from a source of light, to the object being viewed, into our eyes, and ultimately into
    our minds. However, the act of viewing a website or phone app involves information moving
    in two directions: you are peering into the website as much as
    the website is peering back into you.

    If a solitary artist can collect and analyze the data of strangers,
    what can a technology company with 100,000 software engineers do?
