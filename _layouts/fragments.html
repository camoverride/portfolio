    <i>Fragments</i> is a digital collage project where I combined the faces of many people
    I saw on the streets of Seattle into composite images.

    The technology industry feeds on the data of billions of people, combining it into
    models they use to predict and control your behavior. Like these AI models, <i>Fragments</i>
    is the result of data from many people combined together.

    If a solitary artist can collect and analyze the data of strangers,
    what can a technology company with 100,000 software engineers do?
