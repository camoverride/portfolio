An electric eyeball, rubber snake
An image drawn in ProcreateÂ®
Walgreens discount Crest toothpaste
My credit card gets tapped with haste (my credit card history!)
A security camera seems to be
A snowglobe without a snowman to see
The cop in his shiny sunglasses
Who are we, the unwashed masses?

A winter day I once remembered
Before the database that was dismembered
Showed me as a child chest deep in the snow
Deeper Alice, down we go!
Take my hand I have a plan
That you couldn't Google, but you can
See all my texts, please don't look
it's Steph from Tinder, paper book
pale skin, pale eyes, pale dog-eared pages
facebook profiles, linkedin cages

Crab apple tree, swimming hole
The garden where a garden mole
Eats onion stems, these are are the things
I've blocked your number, brr brr ring ring
In the Amazon Prime of my life
My scabbed-up knees, computer knife
Brr brr a snowman with coal camera eyes
Upon a bed of snow, his body lies
Because My Memories, They've All Been Bought And Sold Bought And Sold Again And Again and Again and Again
