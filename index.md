An electric eyeball, rubber snake
An image drawn in ProcreateÂ®
Walgreens discount Crest toothpaste
My credit card gets tapped with haste (my credit card history!)
A security camera seems to be
A snowglobe without a snowman to see
The cop in his shiny sunglasses
[reciept] Who are we, the unwashed masses?

A winter day I once remembered
Before the database that was dismembered
Showed me as a child chest deep in the snow
Deeper Alice, down we go! [Amazon Prime]
Take my hand I have a plan
That you couldn't Google, but you can
See all my texts, please don't look <- at that one from Steph from Tinder
you'll look Like the rubbed raw spine of a paper book

Crab apple tree, swimming hole
The garden where a garden mole
Eats onion stems, these are are the things
I'm locked out of my email, but cell phone rings
   shopping cart! shopping list!
Brr brr a snowman with coal camera eyes
Upon a bed of snow, his body lies
Because my Memories, They've All Been Bought And Sold And Recycled Again and Again and Again
