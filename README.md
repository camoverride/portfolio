just another jekyll template I've hacked...

- [ ] add `favicon-16x16.png` and `favicon-32x32.png` / fix up `_includes/favicon.html`
- [ ] clean up `_config.yml` / remove projects stuff
- [ ] check that analytics is running
- [ ] is `site.webmanifest` depricated?
- [ ] finish up first blog post
- [ ] change `blog` route to `resources`
